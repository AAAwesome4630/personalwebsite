                <h5 class="animated mb-3" style="padding: 25px"> The foundation of every first world country began with small business. It's what allows for economic growth and stimulates developing economies. However, in many developing countries today, 
                        there exists no framework for aspiring entreprenuers to jumpstart their businesses. Although many of these entreprenuers have truly visionary
                        and brilliant ideas, starting a successful company in developing third world countries is exponentially hard. This is caused by a variety of factors:
                        from lack of infrastructure, not enough avaiable funding, difficulty reaching markets with the ability to pay, political crisises, and harsh government
                        regulations. <br /> <br />

                        The solution to this devestating problem of poverty is to venture deep into the roots of these developing countries and foster
                        economic growth through small business. Our Solution is a platform in which these small businesses would be given grants, connection to foreign markets,
                        help with logitistics, and advice from experienced mentors.

                </h1>
    
                <h5 class="animated mb-3" style="padding: 25px"> x-rays fulfill an essential need in the medical industry. They give doctors and surgeons the ability to see under the skin, and identify
                    problems and irregularities in bones and other internal organs. However, there are numerous drawbacks to the current X-ray technology.<br /> <br /> 
                    
                    First, it's not the safest. Studies show that excess exposure to x-rays can lead to several life-threatining diseases. Second, It's not cheap. X-ray machines cost hospitals hundreds
                    of thousands of dollars, and to recoup this cost, they charge patients exorbitantly high prices. Also, the skill to read and properly understand the x-ray is very expensive.
                    Finally, X-rays are not portabile, or very accessible. In emergency situations, there is no way for paramedics, or surgeons to quickly determine the internal damage in one's body. 
                    <br /> <br />
                    My goal in this endeavor is to create a portabile x-ray like system the uses either terahertz or visible light frequencies to accuarately, affordably, and quickly image the body

                    selling novelty goods for a good cause. From starting this business, I realizaed that there was a large unfilled void in this space of cause marketing. From a business standpoint,
                    partnering with charities and orginizations is a noble cause, not only will their customer be much more willing to by, they will also be supporting a good cause. For the orginization
                    or charity, this is a wonderful opportunity to gain more much needed funding. Business have a profitable business model, and Orginziations have a loyal, and supportive customer base. <br /> <br />

                    Up until this point, there has been no streamilined solution to connect these business to orginizations to produce this amazing, value-creating win-win situation. But now, meet BizOrg Funding,
                    a one stop shop for both orginizations, and businesses to connect and partner under the umbrella of a good cause.

                    <br /> <br />

                    I seek to develop either a wearable or "invisible ring around the pool", to combat this uneccessarily large statistic.

                <h5 class="animated mb-3" style="padding: 25px"> Now entering my junior year of high school, I've experienced it all when it comes to school. There are those certain weeks where
                    I'm on top of all my homework, tests, and extracurriclars. But more often than not, after a busy week filled with a grueling 6 mile cross-country practices, and numerous club meetings,
                    I remeber that I have to read and entire 60 pages of my textbook, and write a minimum of 5 pages for an outline, and for the next 4 hours, I tirelessly work, and complete 
                    a document with some resemblence of an outline. But that's not the worst, I wake up the next morning with less that 4 hours of sleep, and go through the same exact process again.

                    <br />
                    <br /> 
                    The process I'm describing here is something that is common among all high school students, procrastination. That's why I designed PlanMan. PlanMan is a web application that seemlessly integrates
                    students, teachers, and school administrators into one platform, allowing students like me to easily pace out their assignments and tests, based on a combination of teacher recommendation
                    and machine learning algorithims. Additionally, PlanMan seeks to improve communication between students and faculty, through the use of announcments connected to phone notifications,
                    as well administrator oversight.
