                        <h5 class="animated mb-3" style="padding: 25px"> Hey, I'm Adith, a 16 year old high school student. I currently live in Phoenix, AZ, and I attend BASIS Phoenix. 

                            <br /> <br />

                            When people ask: "what's your passion" or "what do you want to do", I give a simple one-word answer: Entreprenuership.

                            <br /> <br />
                            I love computers and technology. The idea that with just a computer that I could create something that had the potential to revolutionize the world is something that just amazed me. After I was first introduced to programming several years ago, I knew immediately that this was the path for me. <br /> <br />
                            Every time I used to travel past my exit ramp to get to my house, there would always be a homeless person sitting at the corner holding his sign: “God Bless". At the time, I didn’t really strike me as a big problem. The first time I really understood the scope of poverty in the world was several years ago, when my mom showed my a very personal and emotional video about poverty in India. Previously, I knew it was a problem, but for the first time I compared them to myself and I realized all the things I took for granted like food, water, family, electricity, we’re struggles for almost half the world. <br /> <br />
                            From this harsh realization, came my interest in business. After watching that video, I cried, which was quite unusual, and a new goal formed in my mind: to change the world by helping as many people as possible. Why Business? Well, I tried brainstorming on how I’d truly impact the lives of many in an impactful way solely with my interest in computers. Nothing really came to mind. But then I looked at the great businessmen: Bill Gates, Elon Musk, I realized that if I had to combine my love for technology with the platform of business to really make an impact on the world and do the most amount of good in the world.
